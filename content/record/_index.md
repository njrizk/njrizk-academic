The Peer Video Recording Library at Computer Science offers another space for students to talk their way into learning. Students record their own problem solving startegy responding to labs or Homework or Group Assignment.
As a supplement to classroom content, video recording is a flexible and accessible space for student practice.

When students are self-assessing or reflecting on their strengths, or challenges, recording their thoughts instead of writing offers a space free of red pen marks. In video recording, students can back up, self-correct, and restate as they think. Most students are already eager to talk about their experiences. With video recording, they can complete the assignment in a medium with which many of them are already quite practiced and comfortable.
