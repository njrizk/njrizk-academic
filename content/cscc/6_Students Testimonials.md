  "My experience in the Consulting Clinic is a professional work experience on my resume. Dr Rizk is a great mentor and leads me into an excellent experience in addition to developing a successful mentorship relationship with Professor Rizk. The consulting Clinic has given me the most rewarding experience in my Computer Science degree. Through my role in CSCC, I had the opportunity to work closely with clients and contribute to their cases. It was a rewarding experience to contribute to the local community, refine my programming skills and find what Iâ€™m most passionate about."
