<span style="color:blue">**What is the CS Consulting Clinic?** </span> 

Universities have been transformed in many ways, major and minor. It is truly time to create a new kind of a real-world setting that provides access to experience to a much more diverse student population, as easily as it reaches out to “engage” the larger community.
The CS Consulting Clinic is a framework for integrating experiential learning and service-learning effectively into computer science curriculum. In the Consulting Clinic course students will act as consultant to Houston entrepreneurs within the SURE™ Program. It is a practicum course for computer science students using SURE Entrepreneurs as clients.
The CS Consulting Clinic will be expanded as a partnership with the Executive Service Corps of Houston (ESCH). The large number of nonprofit clients of ESCH’s need computing services. It is a great opportunity to enhance the learning experience of UH students by utilizing their technical skills to solve the problem of selected nonprofits clients.
Consulting Clinic will embrace an important aspect of learning and discovery “engagement,” will enhance society through community engagement, expertise and learning opportunity in experiential learning settings, and will prepare students for productive citizenship.

We work with clients that are a good match for our student-led program and fit our other selection criteria.

Even if you apply, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accept you as a client or provide assistance with any of the matters you describe in the application. 

We attempt to provide an initial response to applicants within 10 business days.
