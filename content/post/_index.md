I have been with University of Houston for 14 years, and have had the opportunity to serve on a wide range of campus committees, including the Faculty Senate, Faculty Senate Undergraduate Committee, Teaching Excellence Award Committee (Chair), Farfel Committee, Scholarship and Learning abroad Committee, Students fees Committee and NSM grievance Committee(Chair). I believe serving on the NSM Committees is an important duty to give back to the College. I firmly believe in the importance of the faculty voice and involvement in the governance of the University. I also value the opportunity to work collaboratively with colleagues in NSM college from different areas across campus, benefiting from their varied perspectives. 
As a faculty member, I have a passion for enhancing students experience to achieve their highest potential. Within my department, as a director of undergraduate studies major accomplishment was accomplished such as creating a data science minor, adding different channels of capstones: Graphics, Software Engineering, Data science and Senior Project.
I am very excited about the possibility of being able to serve on the NSM Standing Committee. I ask to be elected because I am willing and more than happy to dedicate all the time and effort that would be required for providing a wonderful service
