It is an opportunity for the students to enhance their homework submission: 
For example, assume the homework4 deadline is **3/11/20xx**
- **Scenario 1:**
- The code is uploaded under hw4 folder on time, after grading your hw4 grade is 100. No need for regrading
- **Scenario 2:**
- The code is uploaded under hw4 folder **on time**, after grading your hw4 grade is 50 (first grading), - and you want to resubmit
- a.	Modify your code and reupload under the same folder in this case hw4
- b.	Wait for the regrading time
  - 1.\	Two days after the deadline (**3/13**) at the same time (second grading) out of 80%
  - 2.\	Four days after the deadline (**3/15**) at the same time (third grading) out of 50%

   - Using 1. your final grade on hw4 will be: firstgrading +(secondgrading-firstgrading)*80 %
   - If your second grading is 80                                    50 + (80-50) *80/100   = 74

    - Using 1. And 2.:firstgrading +(secondgrading-firstgrading)*80 %  +(thirdgrading-second grading)*50%
    - If your third grading is 100                     50 + (80-50) *80/100  +(100-80)*50/100 = 84 

- **Final regrading at the end of the semester:**
- This is an opportunity to enhance one homework, you can try to enhance all the homework by updating - - all the codes submitted in their respective folders, however only the best regrade will be considered.
- Example Scenario:
- Grades before the final regrade
- Hw1:50     Hw2:70    Hw3:30      Hw4:90
- After regrade 
- Hw1:40     Hw2:80    Hw3:50      Hw4:100
- **Final Grades** 
- Hw1:50     Hw2:70   **Hw3:50**      Hw4:90   **Hw3 has the best regrade** (Only this grade will be uploaded)
