Then select which project / topic and apply all the steps on the data set selected
Add a description cell before each cell and a result interpretation cell after main results.
Email the TA ahead of time the project selected as well as the dataset name.
Name your project as COSC3337_Project#_LastnameFirstname and submit as .ipynb (and .pdf is optional)
