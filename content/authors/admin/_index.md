My teaching philosophy reflects my interests in creating an atmosphere that fosters
learning and facilitates student discovery, supporting and challenging them both inside
and outside of the classroom. I am highly in favor of peer learning, which is a powerful
method for sharing knowledge, ideas, and experience, and it influences student-learning
outcomes in a positive, measurable way. My other approach of efficiently implementing
my teaching philosophy is gamifying the classroom which strongly increases student
engagement and motivation. My teaching activities were rewarded by receiving the
departmental Teaching Excellence Award (2012) and University of Houston Teaching
Excellence Award (2017). I was also nominated for the NSM Butler Teaching Award.
